                Scorespace is an innovative, new type of gamejam, which attempts to integrate the players into the gamejam as much as the
                developers already are. This is done by allowing players to participate in the jam, alongside the developers who enter. 
                After the game developers have created the games and the judges have chosen the winners, it is up to the gamers to achieve
                the highest score in each game.

                The jam starts with the game developers - their job is simply to create a game within a 72 hour period. No assets or code can
                be created outside of this period. Once those three days are over, there is another three day judging period in which the games 
                are judged by their overall quality. The top three recieve a prize and a youtube video announcing their winnings.

                After the developers have made their masterpieces, the torch is then passed to the gamers. The gamers have a 72 hour period 
                (see a pattern?) to play the winning games. Whichever player achieves the highest score in each game also recieves a prize,
                and a youtube video announcing their names.
