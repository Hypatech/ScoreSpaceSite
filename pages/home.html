                Scorespace is an innovative, new type of gamejam, which attempts to integrate the players into the gamejam as much as the
                developers already are. This is done by (after the games are developed) allowing the players to compete against each other
                in order to get a high score. Not only are prizes available for the developers creating these awesome games, but there are
                also prizes for those who get involved and keep them alive - you!
