                Scorespace is an innovative, new type of gamejam, which attempts to integrate the players into the gamejam as much as the
                developers already are. This is done by allowing players to participate in the jam, alongside the developers who enter. 
                After the game developers have created the games and the judges have chosen the winners, it is up to the gamers to achieve
                the highest score in each game.
