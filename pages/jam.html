            <b>THE THEME FOR THE JAM IS: WAVES!</b>
            <br>
            <div class="sectioncontent" style="padding: 5px; text-align: center;">
                Waves are absolutely everywhere - sound waves, sea waves, shockwaves or even waves of zombies or orcs! This makes it a perfect theme; your game could be anything from a wave-based shooter to an experimental puzzle game involving sound. We're sure that the community will come up with many crazy ideas that didn't even cross our minds for a second. If you have a great idea... <br>
                Get out there and make it!
