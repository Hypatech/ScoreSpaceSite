                You can make the game in a team of any size. That can be anywhere from just one person all the way to the population of earth. It's recommended to keep the team size small, however - sizes too big become unmanageable fast.

                If your game is NSFW, it is required that you have a warning at the start of the game or in the description text. We dont want to be scarred for life, thanks.
