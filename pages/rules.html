    <b>Rules</b>
        <ul>
            <li>All games must include a leaderboard system so that the gamers can compete for the highscore if you happen to win the contest.</li>
            <li>You can make the game on your own or in a team (of any size). It is suggested to keep your team at a max of four people because it is hard to manage a larger team during a game-jam. </li>
            <li>All game engines (and frameworks) are allowed!</li>
            <li>Games that are NSFW should have a warning in the description or when the game first loads up.</li>
            <li>We suggest that you and your team make everything from scratch during the event. It is okay if you use assets made by someone else as long as you give them credit in the description of your game.</li>
            <li>All games submitted must be digital games that can be played on Web, Windows, Linux, or Mac.</li>
            <li>Finally, have fun developing and gaming!</li>
        </ul>
