                        <b>THE THEME IS... DESTRUCTION!</b>
                        <p>
                        Usually, we like to keep our themes pretty vague and tame. Let's change that. <br>
                        We want you to make games about DESTROYING! We want to crush things and LAUGH as they crumble! <br><br>
                        NO MORE GROWTH! JUST DESTRUCTION! MUAHAHAHAHAHAAAHAAA!<br><br>
                        ...all jokes aside, the theme for our next jam is destruction! We felt like this would be a really fun one to both play and create, and we hope you feel the same too. So go out there and make us some fun games!<br><br>
                        If you'd like to join, please go to our <a href="https://itch.io/jam/scorejam5" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">itch page</a> for instructions on how to participate! Have fun!
