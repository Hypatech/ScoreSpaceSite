                        <b>THE THEME IS... UNDERGROUND!</b>
                        <p>
                            There's undeniable a sense of mystery to do with everything underground, whether that means simply below the earth or outside-of-mainstream view. This is why we picked it as our theme for our latest jam; there is so much potential for creativity!
                            <br><br>
                            As usual, every game must have a high-score system in place (online or offline) and must follow every rule laid out in the gamedev page. For the streamer side of the jam, simply make sure you are able to record your screen and send the recording to us.
                            <br><br>
